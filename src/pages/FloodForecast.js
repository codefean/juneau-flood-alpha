This page provides information about real-time monitoring efforts. The USGS monitors Suicide Basin using time-lapse cameras and a laser range finder
 to track water levels — <strong>though icebergs that float in front of the laser may cause levels to jump around</strong>. Mendenhall Lake levels are also tracked
  continuously at a site on the west shore. Lake level is an important predictor of downstream flood impacts following an outburst from Suicide Basin.

  <h2>Forecasting Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs)</h2>
  <p>
    Suicide Basin is a glacier-dammed lake that can suddenly release large volumes of water, triggering outburst floods that impact the Mendenhall Valley. Forecasting these floods requires constant monitoring of water levels and understanding changes in the basin’s structure over time. The USGS tracks Suicide Basin using time-lapse cameras with elevation scale bars and precise laser range finders. However, floating icebergs can skew readings by altering the visible water surface. Monitoring is active from spring through fall.
  </p>


  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Flood Potential:</strong> The volume of water and the release rate from Suicide Basin determine flooding severity. Researchers use drone-based surveys to create three-dimensional terrain models and estimate total water volume.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Changing Water Elevations:</strong> The basin’s capacity evolves over time due to glacier thinning, iceberg calving, and internal ice melt—affecting how much water it can store before an outburst.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Time to Prepare:</strong> Once drainage begins, floodwaters typically reach Mendenhall Lake within 1–2 days, offering a brief window for preparation. <a

Here's how the hydrograph looked when this occured in 2024.
</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Flood Season:</strong> Outburst floods most commonly occur between June and October, with peak events typically in July and August.

        <p>
        Mendenhall Lake is a glacially-fed lake at the terminus of Mendenhall Glacier. Water levels fluctuate due to seasonal melting, precipitation, and outburst floods. The <a href="https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/15052500/#dataTypeId=continuous-00065--1654777834&period=P7D&showMedian=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              USGS monitors water level
            </a> (also referred to as stage) along the lake’s west shore to track these changes in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
        The water level in Mendenhall Lake is measured every 15 minutes by a sensor in the lake. The NWS uses forecasts of rainfall,
        glacier melt, and water release from Suicide Basin to forecast water levels
        in Mendenhall Lake (graph, left). During outburst floods, lake levels can rise rapidly, posing a significant flood risk.
        For example, during the August 2024 outburst flood, the water level in Mendenhall Lake <a href="https://flood-events.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mlake_hydrograph.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
        surged by over 10 ft in just two days.
      </a> Such extreme fluctuations
        highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and early warnings.
        </p>
        <p>
        When the water level in Mendenhall Lake is forecasted to exceed the flood stage, a flood watch or warning is issued. When the water
        level exceeds 9ft, flooding can occur in Mendenhall Valley. Flood stages for Mendenhall Lake range from minor (9-10 ft) to major (14+ ft)
        and are color coded to highlight known impacts documented by the NWS (below).

  <h2>Understanding Flood Stages</h2>
  <p>
    Flood stages indicate the severity of flooding based on lake water levels. These stages help 
    communities, emergency responders, and individuals assess potential risks and take necessary precautions. 
    The National Weather Service defines four primary flood categories: Action Stage, Minor, Moderate, and Major Flooding. The current flood stage and water level is shown above.
  </p>

  <div>
    <strong>Action Stage (8 - 9ft):</strong> Water levels have reached bankfull conditions and minor flooding will occur above this level. Residents should begin to take mitigation actions for flooding events based on their location.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>8 ft:</strong> Bankfull risk starts.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <strong>Minor Flooding (9 - 10.5 ft):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>9 ft:</strong> Water starts covering Skaters Cabin Rd and flows into Mendenhall Campground.</li>
      <li><strong>9.5 ft:</strong> 0.5 ft of water covers Skaters Cabin Rd. Campsite 7 flooded; water over the road between campsites 8 and 9.</li>
      <li><strong>10 ft:</strong> Mendenhall Campground inundated with up to 3 ft of water. Skaters Cabin Rd has up to 1.5 ft of water. Portions of West Glacier Trail impassable. Minor yard flooding on View Dr begins.</li>
      <li><strong>10.5 ft:</strong> Over 3 ft of water near Mt. McGinnis trailhead. Mendenhall Campground evacuation starts.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <strong>Moderate Flooding (11 - 14 ft):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>11 ft:</strong> Yards flood on View Dr (up to 1.5 ft of water). Bank erosion begins below Back Loop Bridge. Backyard flooding on Meander Way. Dredge Lake Trail impassable; floodwaters reach Dredge Lake.</li>
      <li><strong>11.5 ft:</strong> Road past 9374 View Dr begins to flood. Water nears some homes at end of View Dr.</li>
      <li><strong>12 ft:</strong> Bank erosion worsens. 0.5 ft water on road past 9374 View Dr. Flooding begins in some homes on View Dr.</li>
      <li><strong>12.5 ft:</strong> 2–4 ft of water in Meander Way backyards.</li>
      <li><strong>13 ft:</strong> 2 ft of water on road past 9374 View Dr. 1–2 ft of water in some homes on View Dr.</li>
      <li><strong>13.5 ft:</strong> Water backs up behind homes between Riverside Dr and Mendenhall River School. Yard flooding begins on River Rd. Severe bank erosion along the river.</li>
      <li><strong>14 ft:</strong> Road past 9374 View Dr impassable. More homes on View Dr see moderate to major flooding. Water approaches driveways on River Rd.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div>
    <strong>Major Flooding (14+ ft):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>15 ft:</strong> Major home flooding on View Dr. Water in backyards and driveways along River Rd. Up to 1 ft of water on Riverside Dr near Tournure St and Mendenhall River School.</li>
